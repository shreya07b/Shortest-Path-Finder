Shortest Path Finder 

A Python-based Shortest Path Finder that visually demonstrates pathfinding algorithms in a maze. This project uses Pygame for graphical visualization, making it interactive and engaging.
It finds the shortest path in a maze using Breadth-First Search (BFS). The program dynamically explores the maze, highlighting the search process and the final path.
The program automatically finds the shortest path from start (O) to end (X).
The animation highlights the pathfinding process.
